I am a PhD candidate in Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at UT Austin, co-advised by Mathew Leibold (University of Florida) and Caroline Farrior (UT Austin). I study basic and applied community and ecosystem ecology, mostly using freshwater food webs as study systems. My approaches include field and laboratory experiments, modeling, and data analysis.

My dissertation bridges food web ecology and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning to investigate how changes in the structure of the top part of food webs (where the predators are) can have cascading effects that alter the functioning and stability of key properties of the base of the food web, such as primary production.
